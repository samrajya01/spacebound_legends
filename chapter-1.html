Amongst the cosmic tapestry, Lumos and Orion, steadfast friends, embark on a relentless search for a planet shrouded in mystery—a planet that once housed an advanced and enigmatic civilization.

Legends and tales of this long-lost civilization's magnificence reverberated throughout the universe. Its mighty rulers held dominion over numerous planets, possessing unimaginable knowledge and boundless riches.
